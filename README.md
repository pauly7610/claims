## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (optional, for production deployment)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd claims
npm install
```

2. **Start development environment:**
```bash
# Start all services in development mode
npm run dev

# Or start specific services
npm run dev --filter=@claims/customer-portal
npm run dev --filter=@claims/claims-service
```

3. **Set up AI/ML environment:**
```bash
cd ml
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Start observability stack:**
```bash
npm run docker:up
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build all applications
npm run build

# Deploy with Docker Compose
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:up

# Or deploy to Kubernetes
npm run k8s:deploy
```

## 🎨 Design System

The project includes a comprehensive design system built with React and Storybook:

```bash
# Start Storybook for component development
npm run storybook
```

Key design principles:
- Modern, accessible UI with light/dark theme support
- Bento grid layouts for dashboards
- Smooth animations and microinteractions
- Mobile-first responsive design
