# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI-Powered Insurance Claims Processing Agent with Full Observability

### **Overview**
Build a robust, production-grade insurance claims processing agent powered by AI and backed by a comprehensive observability and evaluation suite. This system will automate intake, validation, assessment, and settlement for insurance claims, drastically improving speed, accuracy, and transparency, while aligning with Aakash Gupta’s leading practices for AI PMs.

***

## 1. **Background & Goals**
Manual insurance claims processing is slow, error-prone, costly, and frustrating for both customers and adjusters. AI can automate critical steps—data validation, fraud detection, documentation review, and approval—while providing transparent, measurable business impact.

**Goals:**
- Automate end-to-end insurance claims workflow
- Drive measurable improvements in speed, accuracy, and customer experience
- Provide full observability and evals for continuous improvement
- Align implementation with AI PM best practices (prototyping, observability, evals, technical intuition)

***

## 2. **User Personas**
- **Customer/Claimant:** Submits claims via web/mobile, expects fast, transparent resolution and status updates
- **Claims Adjuster:** Reviews cases, focuses on edge scenarios and high-complexity claims
- **Product Manager:** Monitors system performance, intervenes on problems, iterates on requirements
- **Business Stakeholder:** Tracks metrics (processing speed, cost, customer satisfaction) for ROI

***

## 3. **Key Features**

### **A. End-to-End Claims Workflow Automation**
- **Intake:** Customizable dynamic forms, document/photo upload, policy validation
- **Validation & Triage:** AI validates policy details, checks coverage, triages claim based on severity, complexity, fraud risk
- **Assessment:** AI extracts, analyzes documents; initial damage estimate; flags anomalies
- **Approval & Settlement:** Straight-through processing for simple claims; human-in-the-loop for flagged cases

### **B. AI Capabilities**
- **Natural Language Processing:** Extract key information from descriptions/reports
- **Computer Vision:** Analyze uploaded photos/documents for damages, authenticity
- **Predictive Modeling:** Estimate claim payment amounts, settlement timelines
- **Fraud Detection:** Pattern recognition, anomaly detection, risk scoring

### **C. Observability & Monitoring Suite**
- **Traces/Logs:** Every AI decision, data input, system step logged for auditability
- **Metrics Dashboard:** Real-time KPIs (see Section 5)
- **Alert System:** Notifications for failure modes, unusual delays, fraud detection, drift events
- **Evaluation Framework:** Automated and human-in-the-loop evals for claims quality, correctness, and customer experience

### **D. Integration & API Layer**
- **External Systems:** Policy management, payment, CRM, compliance databases via RESTful APIs
- **Mobile/Web Frontends:** Secure portals for claimants and adjusters featuring status updates, messaging, doc upload

### **E. Security & Compliance**
- Role-based access control, audit trails, GDPR/HIPAA compliance for sensitive data
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### **F. Documentation & Analytics**
- Detailed README and architecture docs for transparency
- Business impact analysis and technical eval report
***

## 4. **Workflow / System Flow**
1. **Claim Submission:** Web/mobile UI, smart forms, doc/photo uploads, initial validation via backend API
2. **Coverage Verification:** API checks policy status, coverage limits, deductible; routes claim if coverage is valid
3. **AI Assessment:** NLP & vision models extract, rate, and validate information; risk/fraud score assigned
4. **Approval Routing:** Straight-through if below risk threshold; human review if flagged
5. **Payment Initiation:** Payment processing through linked third-party systems, status updates sent to claimant
6. **Observability Capture:** Every decision and workflow step logged, monitored on dashboards with alerts for critical issues
7. **Continuous Evaluation:** Automatic metrics collection (accuracy, settlement time, fraud alerts, user satisfaction); human eval loop for flagged decisions
***

## 5. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
**Primary KPIs:**
1. **Average Claim Resolution Time:** Goal: <24 hours for standard claims[1][2]
2. **Claim Closure Ratio:** Track processed vs open claims; goal: ≥95% closure rate in period[3]
3. **Fraud Detection Rate:** % of fraudulent claims flagged (precision/recall tracked)[4]
4. **Average Payout per Claim:** Used for forecasting and risk management[5][2]
5. **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):** Survey-based, target: ≥85%[1]
6. **Claims Frequency/Volume:** Used for load testing, risk exposure monitoring
7. **Model Accuracy & Error Rate:** Human-evaluated claim correctness, goal: ≥99%
8. **Drift Events Logged & Addressed:** Frequency and duration of model/data drift incidents

***

## 6. **Requirements**

### **Business Requirements**
- System must process at least 85% of claims with straight-through automation
- All claim decisions and documentation must be auditable and explainable
- Must integrate with existing policy, payment, and CRM systems via secure APIs
- System should automatically escalate edge cases to human adjusters

### **Functional Requirements**
- Dynamic, extensible AI pipeline supporting NLP, vision, predictive models, rules
- Observability layer captures real-time metrics, system traces, and errors
- Evaluation suite for ongoing monitoring (automation + human-in-the-loop)
- Alerting and notification for exceptions, fraud events, workflow delays

### **Technical Requirements**
- Modular microservices (FastAPI or Flask for backend, React for frontend)
- Scalable data pipeline for document/image handling and streaming analytics
- Secure cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure), Docker/Kubernetes for portability
- Feature-rich dashboards (Evidently AI, Grafana)
- CI/CD for automated deploy, rollback

***

## 7. **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime, robust error handling/fallbacks
- **Scalability:** Handle 10,000+ claims/month with <1s query latency
- **Security:** Fully encrypted PHI/PII, GDPR/HIPAA compliance, role-based access

***

## 8. **Risks & Mitigations**
- **Model Drift:** Integrate drift detection, automated re-training triggers
- **Regulatory changes:** Modular policy/rules engine for quick updates
- **Edge Cases:** Human-in-loop always available for exceptions; feedback loop for model improvement
- **User Adoption:** Comprehensive onboarding, clear status comms, multi-channel support

***

## 9. **Evaluation Pathways**
- Define human and automated evaluation criteria for correctness, compliance, and user experience
